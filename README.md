The cross-platform, [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin manager that adheres to the
[Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and Python best practices.

Some focuses of the project are:

1. Easy and simple commands (updating all your plugins is as simple as `spud update`)

1. Adherence to Unix conventions and no forced interactivity, which unlike other options like [pluGET](https://github.com/Neocky/pluGET), makes Spud easy to use in scripts.

1. Readability, static type hinting, test-driven development, and consistent styling in the codebase.

1. Descriptive and greppable output with actionable error messages


## Installation
Python 3.8 or later is required

Install with `python -m pip install spud-mc`

Run `spud -h` to see all the options.


## Example usages
- Install a plugin: `spud install PluginName`

- Install a plugin without prompting for input: `spud -n install PluginName`

- Update all plugins in the working directory: `spud update`

- Update all plugins in `~/server/plugins`: `spud -d ~/server/plugins update`
 
- Update plugin `myplugin.jar`: `spud update myplugin.jar`

## Known Issues
- Some resources have lots of filler in the title. e.g. `[1.8-1.17] Â· PluginName |
ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ | Epic Gaming Moments`.
Spud tries its best to extract the plugin name, but it will fail if there is copious amounts of garbage in the title


- Spud can't update plugins it has not installed. Make sure to install the plugin with Spud first, so it can save a metadata file to the jar.


- Spud can't install resources not listed on https://spigotmc.org


- Spud can't install premium resources

## Setting up a dev environment
`git clone git@github.com:exciteabletom/spud`

`cd spud`

`python3 -m venv .venv`

Bash: `. .venv/bin/activate`

Windows PowerShell: `.venv\bin\activate.ps1`

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`

`pre-commit install`

A cross-platform, [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin manager that adheres to
[Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and conventions.

Work in progress.

## Installation
Python 3.8 or later is required

Install with `python -m pip install spud-mc`

Run `spud -h` to see all the options.


## Example usages
- Install a plugin: `spud install PluginName`
- Install a plugin without prompting for input: `spud -n install PluginName`
- Update all plugins in the working directory: `spud update`
- Update all plugins in `~/server/plugins`: `spud -d ~/server/plugins update`
- Update plugin `myplugin.jar`: `spud update myplugin.jar` or `spud update myplugin`

## Known Issues
- Some resources have lots of filler in the title. e.g. `[1.8-1.17] Â· PluginName |
ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸ˜ƒ | Epic Gaming Moments`.
Spud tries its best to extract the plugin name, but it will fail if there is copious amounts of garbage in the title


- Spud can't update plugins it has not installed. Make sure to install the plugin with Spud first, so it can save a metadata file to the jar.


- Spud can't install resources not listed on https://spigotmc.org
